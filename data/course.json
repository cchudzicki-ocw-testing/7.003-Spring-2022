You will spend most of your time in the teaching laboratory practicing fundamental techniques in molecular biology, genetics and cell biology. In addition to learning how to accurately and safely perform these techniques, we want to help you understand how and why these techniques work and what scientific questions these techniques can address. The goal is for you to be able to design your own experiments to perform by the end of the semester.",
