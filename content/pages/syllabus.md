## Course Description

7.003 is an experimental biology course. You will spend most of your time in the teaching laboratory practicing fundamental techniques in molecular biology, genetics and cell biology. In addition to learning how to accurately and safely perform these techniques, we want to help you understand how and why these techniques work and what scientific questions these techniques can address. The goal is for you to be able to design your own experiments to perform by the end of the semester. Our focus is on helping you integrate factual knowledge with an understanding of experimental design and data analysis – skills that will be important should you take a more advanced level lab course, later pursue a UROP, or go on to graduate or medical school.

In this course, you will be working on the model organism, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (budding yeast). You will be performing a mutagenesis screen to isolate mutants defective in the yeast mating pathway. You will then work to characterize these mutants and identify the disrupted genes involved. Through lectures and daily lab questions related to each lab session, you will learn the biology behind the experiments that you will carry out in the laboratory and will also be exposed to techniques beyond the scope of this course.

In addition to working in the laboratory, you will also be learning to communicate your scientific findings to a broader audience. Much of a practicing scientist's time is spent writing and communicating their results in the form of grant applications, manuscripts, talks, and poster presentations. In the biweekly Scientific Communication (SciComm) section meetings, you will explore the five parts of a scientific research article (Introductions, Methods, Results/Figures, Discussion, Title and Abstract). You will have the opportunity to read and critique papers from the biological science literature. Your major written assignment will be a long-term project based upon the experiments completed in the lab. This writing assignment will be drafted and revised over the course of the term. You will receive feedback on both writing and technical aspects of your draft, and you will be encouraged to use this feedback to improve your writing through frequent revisions.

## Laboratory Notebooks and Manuals

Maintaining an updated record of your daily work in lab is an essential component of research. Therefore, each student must maintain an electronic laboratory notebook using the LabArchives\[add link\] platform.

Each student will need a lab manual for 7.003.  The manual contains the experiments and background information for the course and is required to perform the lab and prepare each day’s laboratory notebook entry.  A digital PDF copy of the Spring 2022 lab manual is available in the Lab Resources\[add link\] section.
