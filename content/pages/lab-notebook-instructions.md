## LabArchives 

The on-campus 7.003 course uses the [LabArchives](https://www.labarchives.com/) platform to maintain electronic laboratory notebooks. Students each create individual accounts on MIT LabArchives, and submit their Pre-Lab and Post-Lab assignments there. 

## Pre-Lab Notebook Entry Guidelines

#### (The Pre-Lab is due on LabArchives by 1:00 PM the day of that lab)

Aims:

- What you will be doing
- How you will be doing it
- Why you are doing it

Note: If your entire daily Aims is longer than ~3 – 5 sentences, you’re probably including more detail than you need!

## Post-Lab Notebook Entry Guidelines

#### (The Post-Lab is due on LabArchives by 1:00 PM the following lab day)
