## General Lab Safety Rules

1. No eating or drinking in the lab (this includes water bottles). Food wrappers or containers are NOT allowed in the trash bins in the lab - they must be disposed of outside the lab.
2. Large personal items (bags, coats, etc) may be stored in the lab during class but should be kept out of the way (there is space and hooks under the benches along the side of the lab that you may use to store or hang up such larger items like bookbags and coats). Please keep all aisles and floor space in the lab clear and free of clutter at all times.
3. Wear appropriate clothing: 
    - No open-toe shoes!!
    - Long pants and long sleeves are recommended in the lab
    - Tie long hair back
4. Gloves and lab coat should be worn at all times while working in the lab - this protects you and also prevents you from contaminating your experiments. Safety glasses should be worn when appropriate. Remove all protective clothing (gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses) before leaving the lab (including bathroom breaks).
5. Glove rules: 
    - Remove gloves to handle non-lab equipment (e.g. doors, phones, computers)
    - Don't touch your face, hair, etc. with your gloves when working at the bench
    - Dispose of all used gloves in the gray "burn boxes"
    - Do NOT throw gloves in the normal trash!
6. There is no smoking allowed in the lab or anywhere inside the building.
7. COVID-19 guidelines:  
    - You must complete all required COVID Pass daily health attestations and weekly testing requirements to have access to Building 68 and the teaching lab space.
    - Masks or cloth face coverings must be worn at all times while in the teaching lab or in public common areas of the building (e.g. hallways, restrooms, etc). 
    - Although there are no capacity limits in the teaching lab space, please follow social distancing guidelines when possible.
    - You are responsible for wiping down your lab workspace and common-touch surfaces (e.g. benchtop, etc) with 70% ethanol or 10% bleach at the start and end of each lab session.
