## Laboratory Safety

The teaching laboratories are regulated by the same local, state, and federal regulations as MIT's research laboratories. Students will receive safety instruction throughout the semester and are expected to follow the instructions of the staff on matters of safety and waste disposal. In addition, students are responsible for knowing the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for hazardous chemicals used in the laboratory as part of the preparation for laboratory each day. Students who have questions or concerns about laboratory safety should bring them to the attention of the lab instructors.
